# GamePy
A fun maths game with optional levels of difficulty

Run through game.py, the user selects their level of difficulty (from 1 to 4) which will generate random maths
calulations to perform (either addition, subtraction or multiplication. 

User gains points based on level of difficulty and each deifficulty represents the range of random number 
generated for their calculation. For example, level 1 is numbers 0 through to 10 while level 4 is 0 through to
100000.

This project was created as part of my Python course with Geek University.
